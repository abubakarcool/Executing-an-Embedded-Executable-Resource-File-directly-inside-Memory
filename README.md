# Executing an Embedded Executable Resource File directly inside Memory
 I created WinForm C# executable of HellowWorld... Than i Embedded that HelloWorld executable in resource of this program and than ran this program.. So when this program will be executed it will get the resoruce and execute that resource  directly inside the memory.

Every PE(Portable Executable) has an entry point so in the program we need to call entry point of embedded executeble which was Form1.
